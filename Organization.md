# Strategy to Minimise Concurrency Errors
For concurrent database access if the use case only requires reading from the database no control is used. This is because even if the data is slightly out of date it isnâ€™t operated on and committed back in nor are any internal decisions based on it. However if the accessed item is then operated on and committed or a derivative is committed the item will be optimistically locked to allow multiple things to operate on it but only allow the first commit to actually occur and any commits after the first one will be met with an optmistic lock exception.
# Domain Model Oranisation
The general strategy of the domain model is to default to lazy fetching whenever possible to not hurt performance. Where an eager fetch strategy is more effective a select fetch mode is used to minimise the impact on performance. Furthermore, all relationships between classes utilise a cascade strategy, most of these use a combination of persist and remove. So, changes are propagated but also unused items are removed.
